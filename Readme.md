Perl Kernel
===========

A crazy idea of making a scriptable kernel. The goal is to offer the bare minimum functionality required for the perl interpreter to boot. Everything else should be taken care through perl scripting!

Why perl?
=========

It has a solid code base, fast interpreter without the need of any intermediate object files, and a small footprint :)
